# Description of code

My script (cpu_hogger.pl) requires a text file as the command-line argument. It defines array `@signature` and the items in that array are, (in order), the five strings that reveal if a device has been compromised. The script next opens the text file (given through the command-line argument) and feeds the lines into array `@lines`. The script goes through array `@lines` in order. If the line contains relevant information (if its contents contain a line from array `@signature`), it will take the device name from the line and put it in variable `$device`. If `$device` does not exist as a key in hash `$device_hash`, it will make it one and set the content equal to zero. If the current line from `@lines` contains the first element in array `@signature` and if the value in `$device_hash{$device}` is zero, it increases the content in `$device_hash{$device}` by one. If the current line from `@lines` contains the second element in array `@signature` and if the value in `$device_hash{$device}` is one, it increases the content in `$device_hash{$device}` by one, and so on. If the value of `$device_hash{$device}` is equal to four (which will only happen if all five necessary strings in `@signature` were detected in order), it means a hacked device has been detected. Finally, it will print the name, time of impact, and time detected of all of the devices that were hacked.
